 * 1.create credentials.
 * 2.display saved credentials.
 * 3.generate password
 * 4.exit application

### Running unit tests

Run python3.6 credentials_test.py for credential class tests. Run python3.6 test_user.py for user class tests. Bugs. Since there is no database to support the app, once you exit or log out of a session you loose all the credentials and created user. You have to create a new user for every session. You can still use the default login but if you exit the app, you will still loose all the credentials you created.
